# Wouters PhD thesis
I found this on a floppy, and decided to save it from oblivion. 

The Feynman diagrams have been made by the C++ lib FeynDiagram, using the FD facility. The lib might be available on the internet. Didn't get it working.

GNUplot is still around, also these plots have not been reproduced. XVGR seems to be lost. Alas also some data was not stored in the saved tar ball.
