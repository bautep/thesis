Spectroscopic factors of low-energy states in $^{16}$O are calculated with a 
realistic $NN$-potential in a Green's function formalism. 
Long-range correlations are calculated within a large but
finite model space using a
G-matrix interaction. The self-energy in the Dyson equation is approximated
with the so-called 2p1h Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Short-range correlations
(SRC)
are treated with the Bethe-Goldstone equation leading to the G-matrix. The
effect of the SRC is introduced in the finite model space calculation by 
accounting for the energy dependence of the G-matrix.
This induces an additional
 reduction of the spectroscopic factors for quasiparticle states 
close to the Fermi level by about ten percent. Remaining discrepancies with 
experimental data signal a still not quite adequate treatment of 
intermediate- and long-range correlations.
