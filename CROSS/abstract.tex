The longitudinal $^{16}$O\eepp$^{14}$C 
cross-section in plane wave approximation, which is 
proportional to the two-nucleon removal spectral function, is calculated. 
With careful choice of the way it is plotted, it is possible to observe a 
factor 
of two difference between the short-range effects of the Reid and Bonn-A 
potentials for the transition to the $0^+$ ground state of $^{14}$C. 
The transition to the 
first $2^+$ excited state even yields larger differences between the 
realistic potentials.
Also calculations with variational correlation functions from the Argonne 
potential yield significantly different results.
