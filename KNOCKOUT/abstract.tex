A procedure for the calculation of the two-body spectral function of a 
finite nucleus is presented. This spectral function plays an important role in 
the description of the two-nucleon knock-out process. 
Short-range correlation (SRC) effects are incorporated by the introduction of
high-momentum components into the relative two-nucleon wave functions. 
These wave functions are obtained from the Bethe-Goldstone equation in the 
finite nucleus. The G-matrix interaction, that results from the same equation,
is used to deal with the long-range correlations within a large shell model 
space. In this respect the treatment of long- and short-range correlations
is consistent.
