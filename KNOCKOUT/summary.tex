\section{Summary}
In this chapter a computer-ready expression (\ref{eq:CRSF}) has been 
obtained for the two-hole spectral function (\ref{eq:SpecFunc}). In 
order to have a feasible expression for the spectral function the 
model space had to be truncated. The effects of short-range correlations were 
implemented by applying Brueckner's independent pair approach
summing the ladder diagrams of two states outside the model space with the
Bethe-Goldstone equation. In this procedure
a G-matrix was obtained as an effective interaction, and 
the basis wave functions were modified to describe the high-momentum 
components that were otherwise described by the discarded basis 
states.
With the presented expression the methods for the description of long-range 
and short-range effects are formally decoupled and separate approximations can 
be applied independently. 

Numerical results for the two-hole spectral function of $^{16}$O will
be presented in chapter~\ref{chap:PPO}.
