\subsection{Treatment of Long-Range Correlations}
In the method proposed here, in which the ladder diagrams involving 
states outside the chosen model space are summed in the BGE (\ref{eq:BGEG}), 
the correlations within the model space are calculated with the methods 
described in section~\ref{sect:ppRPA}. This structure information is contained 
in the two-particle addition and removal amplitudes 
$X_{\alpha\beta}$ in the spectral function (\ref{eq:SpecFuncW}). 
The Dressed RPA (\ref{eq:DRPA}) will be adopted as one of the most 
advanced methods to describe the effects of correlations. It yields, 
however, a continuous distribution as a function of energy for the 
propagator. To 
extract the amplitudes for energetically well-separated individual final 
states the contour integration method, section~\ref{sec:RPAdisc} will be used.
